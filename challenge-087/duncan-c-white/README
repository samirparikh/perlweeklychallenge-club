Task 1: "Longest Consecutive Sequence

You are given an unsorted array of integers @N.

Write a script to find the longest consecutive sequence. Print 0 if no sequence found.

Example 1:

	Input: @N = (100, 4, 50, 3, 2)
	Output: (2, 3, 4)

Example 2:

	Input: @N = (20, 30, 10, 40, 50)
	Output: 0

Example 3:

	Input: @N = (20, 19, 9, 11, 10)
	Output: (9, 10, 11)
"

My notes: clearly defined, sort it first, then walk list looking for sequences


Task 2: "Largest Rectangle

You are given binary matrix m x n with all values being 0 or 1.

Write a script to find the largest rectangle containing only 1. Print 0 if none found.

Example 1:

Input:
    [ 0 0 0 1 0 0 ]
    [ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ]
    [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 0 ]

Output:
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 ]

Example 2:

Input:
    [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
    [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]
    [ 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
    [ 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]

Output: 0

Example 3:

Input:
    [ 0 0 0 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 0 0 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 0 0 1 1 1 1 ]

Output:
    [ 1 1 1 1 ]
    [ 1 1 1 1 ]
"

My notes: clearly defined, I assume that a rectangle has min-width 2,
min-height 2, brute force: find all rectangles, pick max area
