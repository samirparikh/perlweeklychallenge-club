TASK #2 â€º Find Square
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given matrix of size m x n with only 1 and 0.

Write a script to find the count of squares having all four corners set as 1.
Example 1:

Input: [ 0 1 0 1 ]
       [ 0 0 1 0 ]
       [ 1 1 0 1 ]
       [ 1 0 0 1 ]

Output: 1

Explanation:
There is one square (3x3) in the given matrix with four corners as 1 starts at r=1;c=2.

[ 1 0 1 ]
[ 0 1 0 ]
[ 1 0 1 ]

Example 2:

Input: [ 1 1 0 1 ]
       [ 1 1 0 0 ]
       [ 0 1 1 1 ]
       [ 1 0 1 1 ]

Output: 4

Explanation:
There is one square (4x4) in the given matrix with four corners as 1 starts at r=1;c=1.
There is one square (3x3) in the given matrix with four corners as 1 starts at r=1;c=2.
There are two squares (2x2) in the given matrix with four corners as 1. First starts at r=1;c=1 and second starts at r=3;c=3.
Example 3:

Input: [ 0 1 0 1 ]
       [ 1 0 1 0 ]
       [ 0 1 0 0 ]
       [ 1 0 0 1 ]

Output: 0
