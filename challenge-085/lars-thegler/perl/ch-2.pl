# TASK #2 â€º Power of Two Integers
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given a positive integer $N.

# Write a script to find if it can be expressed as a ^ b where a > 0 and b > 1. Print 1 if you succeed otherwise 0.

# Example 1:
# Input: 8
# Output: 1 as 8 = 2 ^ 3
# Example 2:
# Input: 15
# Output: 0
# Example 3:
# Input: 125
# Output: 1 as 125 = 5 ^ 3
