#         TASK #1 â€º Pair Difference
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given an array of integers @N and an integer $A.
#
#         Write a script to find find if there exists a pair of elements in the
#         array whose difference is $A.
#
#         Print 1 if exists otherwise 0.
#
#         Example 1:
#             Input: @N = (10, 8, 12, 15, 5) and $A = 7
#             Output: 1 as 15 - 8 = 7
#         Example 2:
#             Input: @N = (1, 5, 2, 9, 7) and $A = 6
#             Output: 1 as 7 - 1 = 6
#         Example 3:
#             Input: @N = (10, 30, 20, 50, 40) and $A = 15
#             Output: 0

#         method:
#             a gentle warm-up for the second challenge, this task requires us
#             to find combinations of integers from a set that can produce a
#             certain value as a difference. It's worth noting that it's not
#             specified, only implied by the examples, that the numbers be
#             positive. I see no compelling reason to require this, so we won't.
#
#             We only need to do the calculations in one direction; positive
#             values can be turned into their negative counterparts by reversing
#             the values:
#
#             a - b = c  -->  b - a = -c
#
#             Rather than compute a list of combinations and trying them out, we
#             can try and constrict the search space by first sorting the list
#             in descending order. Then we can start iterating over the values.
#             Even if the first value is not greater than the target, it can
#             theoretically be reduced to fit by subtracting a negative number.
#             We take the next value and subtract it. If the difference is less
#             than the target, we can continue, subtracting a smaller amount
#             with the next value until we match or exceed the goal. One thing
#             is certain, that the computed differences will grow as we move the
#             second value to the right along the list. Consequently, if we
#             exceed the target we immediately move the initial value forward
#             one step.
#
#             What of negative values you ask? Well if we take the absolute
#             value of the target in the beginning we match against that. By use
#             of the equality mentioned above we can change the sign by
#             reversing the values as required. Which we don't have to actually do,
#             we only need to know we can and act on that.
